### Stock-Analysis
Stock analysis based on Daily Volumes and Yearly Returns
## Project Overview
Steve has just graduated with his finance degree. His parents are his first clients. Steve's parents are passionate about green energy and they believe that as fusel fuels got used up there will be more and more reliance on alternative energy production. there are many forms of green energy to invest in including hydro electricity, wind, geothermal and bio energy. However, Steve's parents haven't done much research and decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, which makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Since they have met at Dairy Queen and DAQO's ticker is "DQ", that was all the information they needed. 
## Purpose of the Project
The pupose of the project is to help Steve analyze a handful of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stock.
We need to analyse stock's daily volumes and returns for the year 2017 and 2018. Also, automate the analysis using VBA scripts and finally refactor the code to provide a faster outputs.
## Results
* As we can see from our Analysis, 2017 was a pretty good year for the industry under consideration. All but one company finished 2017 in a green zone with the biggest winner of DQ, however from the liquidity standpoint DQ was the less traded stock for 2017. On the contrary 2018 was not that positive for the markets in general and Green Energy sector in particular. Only two companies (ENPH and RUN) out of our sample showed very good results for the year with both running up for more than 80%. Moreover, the volume for them more than double during 2018 which is promising looking forward. DQ stock was the laggard among the rest, which was not surprising even in normal market conditions following the 200% gains for the previous year. On a positive side for DQ, the volume for 2018 more than tripled YOY. To sum up the mentioned three stocks worth at least monitoring.
