## Project Overview
Steve has just graduated with his finance degree. His parents are his first clients. Steve's parents are passionate about green energy and they believe that as fusel fuels got used up there will be more and more reliance on alternative energy production. there are many forms of green energy to invest in including hydro electricity, wind, geothermal and bio energy. However, Steve's parents haven't done much research and decided to invest all their money into DAQO New Energy Corporation, which makes silicon wafers for solar panels. Since they have met at Dairy Queen and DAQO's ticker is "DQ", that was all the information they needed. Steve is asking to help him analyze a list of green energy stocks in addition to DAQO stock.
